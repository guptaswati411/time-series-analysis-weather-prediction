# Weather Prediction using Time Series Anaylsis

## Approach
The aim of the project is to analyze weather data to predict temperatures. The data includes daily temperature and wind speed data from Jan 1, 2014 to April 24, 2019 of Portland. The data is provided by NOAA. It was collected and filtered using Google Cloud BigQuery. We compare predictions made by univariate and multivariate time series models on the data. We study the effects of wind speed on temperature predictions and the accuracy of the
predictions
